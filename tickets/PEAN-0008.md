- Extend the existing functionality of the existing `<Select />` at the top of the People page.
- Only render entries from API that match the filter.
- When user changes the page, do not reset the filter.

## Acceptance criteria:

- When users navigate to People page, they see a list of people that they can filter by gender. When they go to any  
  other page by using pagination the settings should not reset.
