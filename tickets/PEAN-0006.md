## Implement pagination on People page

- There is already a MUI `<Pagination />` component on the page that needs to be implemented so when users interact  
  with the pagination the data is reloaded.
- Show 10 entries per page by default.

## Acceptance criteria:

- When users navigate to People page, they can see the first 10 people. When they go to a different page, they see  
  10 different people.
