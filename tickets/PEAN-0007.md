## Implement select box to change the maximum amount of people displayed per page

- There is already a MUI `<Select />` that needs to be implemented by extending the previous pagination logic.
- When the amount of people per pages changes in the `<Select />` the app should refetch and re-render the data.

## Acceptance criteria:

- When users navigate to People page, they are able to change the maximum amount of entries that are displayed per page.
- The app automatically refetches the data and displays new amount of people.
- User can go to next page using pagination and the settings do not reset.
