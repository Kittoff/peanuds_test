## Render a list of people on People page

- Render a list of people (`https://swapi.dev/api/people`) by displaying their names using the MUI `<Link />` component.
    - Hint:
      `<Link component={IMPORTED_REACT_ROUTER_DOM_LINK_COMPONENT_NAME} [...other MUI and react-router-dom Link props] />`
      we want to combine the look and feel of MUI `<Link />` component with the functionality of the `<Link />`
      component of `react-router-dom` package. For that one would need to import at least one of those aliased.
- Use `?selected=ID` for search url parameter of the link, where `ID` is the ID of the person from the API.

## Acceptance criteria:

- When users navigate to People page they see a list of names of people. When they click on the person's name they see  
  that the URL is like `http://localhost:5173/people?selected=ID` and the ID changes every time another person is   
  clicked.
